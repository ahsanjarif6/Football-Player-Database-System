The Football Player Database System is a Java-based application for managing football player data. It is a simple footballer database where you can search players under different constraints and buy and sell players between clubs. Built with JavaFX for the user interface, it uses Java Networking for backend communication. The GUI is designed using Scene Builder, JFoenix, and CSS for a modern and responsive design.
